Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient.
Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
that get the most out of multicore and networked machines.

Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience
of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection.

Go is expressive! Go is fun. Don't you think so?
